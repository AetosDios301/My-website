This is my first personal website. https://aetosdios301.github.io/My-website/

Mark 0 was made on 2nd July 2024, and as of date I am a pre-college student about to major in Electronics and Computer engineering.
I currently know C++ and am certified by CodeChef.
But I don't know a lot of things about HTML and CSS or JS, so the website will go through significant changes once I do get to learn about them.

Log/04-07-2024: Mark 1 of the website was made today, this is version of the website now features a working contact form and also now has my GitHub account in the social media section
